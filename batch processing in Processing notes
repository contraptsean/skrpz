found this on the internet.

Use [...] dataPath("") to get the path of the data directory.
means replace File dir = new File("data"); with 
File dir = new File(dataPath(""));


Also:

void setup(){
ArrayList<File> filesList = filesToArrayList();
for(File f : filesList){
println(f.getName());
}
}
ArrayList filesToArrayList() {
ArrayList<File> filesList = new ArrayList<File>();
String folderPath = selectFolder();
if (folderPath != null) {
File file = new File(folderPath);
File[] files = file.listFiles();
for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
filesList.add(files[i]);
}
}
return(filesList);
}


Another Glitch User::
actually it's a lot easier and cleaner to write your code
in the main Draw() and use functions to call, as well as creat
ing a loop in there that will iterate through so you can rename your files xx_01.bmp etc..
